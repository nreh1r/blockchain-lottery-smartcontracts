# blockchain-lottery-smartcontracts

The smart contracts for the blockchain lottery. The smart contracts are coded in solidity and use hardhat as the development and testing framework. The testing in hardhat was done on the hardhat local network, which is while you will find mocks included with the lottery contract, the Rinkeby test net, and a forked mainnet. The contract that the front end is connected to is live on the rinkeby test net.
